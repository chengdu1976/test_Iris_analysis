# Tree model on Iris_analysis to demostrate overfitting 
using the decision tree to classification the iris with different depth

demostrate the error prediction/fitting on both training and testing dataset 

plot error prediction for comparision. 

also calcualte accuracy score to demostrate the overfitting. 

--> conclusion,    the depth of tree is a critical hyper-parameter to avoid overfitting.
